									<p>Kuo's Chinese name is 郭芃廷. He graduated from the Department of Political Science at National Taiwan University and is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Political Science at the same institution. He also serves as a research assistant to Professor Tse-min Fu at Academia Sinica. Kuo's research interests encompass deep learning, large language model applications, electoral systems, and power transition theory. As a research assistant, he constructed a database of significant events in Britain and Germany from 1860 to 1914, providing case study data for Anglo-German power transition explanations, which earned recognition from his professor. Beyond qualitative research, Kuo is responsible for processing cross-national survey data for the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS), utilizing R for statistical analysis and testing. Their research output, "Democracy or Prosperity? A Cross-National Analysis of East Asian Countries," was presented at the 2023 Asian Barometer Conference, demonstrating Kuo's profound understanding of cross-national data analysis.</p>
									<p>During his graduate studies, Kuo developed an interest in deep learning and natural language processing, leading him to extensively study courses in deep learning, data science, natural language processing, linear algebra, and probability. He maintained a strong academic focus, achieving a GPA above 4.0 each semester, ranking fourth in his class with a 4.17 GPA in his first year, and receiving a scholarship from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Kuo's master's thesis, "Exploring the Impact of Electoral Reform on Legislative Candidates' Campaign Strategies Using Machine Learning," was presented at the 2023 Taiwan Political Science Association Conference. He also presented "Decoding Campaigning Strategies: A Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the Impact of Election Systems on Legislative Candidates" at the 2024 Midwest Political Science Association Annual Conference. Currently, Kuo is collaborating with Professor Hong-wung Wang's team to develop a classification model for legislative interpellations, aiming to demonstrate the application of artificial intelligence in political science and the interaction between these disciplines. This work was presented at the 16th International Conference on Parliamentary Studies in June 2024.</p>
									<p>Kuo is currently co-authoring a paper on the effects of electoral reforms in Taiwan and Japan with Ronan Tse-min Fu, Nick Lin, and Akitaka Matsuo. He is also developing classification models with Yu-Hung Sun and Hong-wung Wang, and collaborating with Wayne Hsuan-wei Lee to construct a social network model using WTO data, combining law, political science, and computational social science applications. Additionally, Kuo is working with Yun-nung Chen to study the performance of language models in inducing dialogues from political science and psychological perspectives. Furthermore, he is co-authoring a qualitative study with Ronan Tse-min Fu on the considerations and impacts of TSMC's expansion to the United States.</p>
									<p>In the future, Kuo plans to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the United States, aiming to enhance his professional knowledge and skills in information engineering.</p>
									<p>In addition, Kuo enjoys playing badminton, he was the leader of the department team during 2019-2020. </p>
